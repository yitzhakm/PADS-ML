              Overview
=========================================

This is release 2.0 of the PADS/ML language and compiler. This release
is intended primarily for early adopters. It is beyond prototype
stage, having been used and maintained by the authors a small group of
others for a number of years, but it is not a production release.  The
language and libraries are subject to change.

For more information on PADS/ML, please visit the website at:

   http://www.padsproj.org

Below are instructions for building and testing this distribution of
PADS/ML. Note that PADS/ML has only been tested on the following
architectures:

   Redhat Enterprise Linux 3, 32 bit, x86.
   RedHat Linux 4, 64 bit, x86.
   OS X 10.3, PowerPC
   OS X 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, Intel

=========================================
              Setup
=========================================

N.B.: these instructions use GNU make (often called gmake or make).
Be sure that the make program you are using is GNU make before
proceeding.  

STEP 1: Download and install dependencies.

   In order to get started, you will need the following software:
     1. PADS/C
     2. Objective Caml
     3. camlidl
     4. XMLlight
     5. camlp5
     6. ocamlfind

   Instructions for each of these software packages follow. 

   - PADS/C. A version of the PADS/C runtime is packaged with this
     distribution in the file pads.1.XX.runtime.tar.gz. To use this
     version, follow the directions below. To use an existing version
     of PADS/C, skip to the next section.

     USING THE INCLUDED PADS/C RUNTIME DISTRIBUTION:

     In the root PADS/ML directory you will find a file named
     padsc.runtime.tar.gz. Untar this file to produce a directory
     named "padsc_runtime". Next, you must arrange to have env
     variable PADS_HOME set to this location before doing other steps.
     Once PADS_HOME is set, you can source a DO_SETENV script that
     will set the other env variables that you will need (INSTALLROOT,
     PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.).  DO_SETENV will also make your
     installation directories (rooted at INSTALLROOT) if they do not
     exist yet.

     Below are instructions for different kinds of shells.  You could
     do the following by hand, or add them to your shell init script.
     Note: Use DO_SETENV rather than Q_DO_SETENV when running from the
     command line to see how the env variables are set up.
  
     Example for csh/tcsh users:
       setenv PADS_HOME /home/pat/padsml/padsc_runtime
       source $PADS_HOME/scripts/Q_DO_SETENV.tcsh

     Example for sh/ksh/bash users:
       export PADS_HOME=/home/pat/padsml/pads_runtime
       . $PADS_HOME/scripts/Q_DO_SETENV.sh

     Finally, all the build steps for PADS/C can be done with one
     command.

       > make

     * NB: Make sure you do *not* have an 'nmake' program in your path.
       If you do, you should temporarily modify your PATH environment
       variable to remove the dir(s) that have nmake.  After performing
       an initial make you can restore your PATH to its previous setting.
  
     USING AN EXISTING PADS/C DISTRIBUTION:

     Often, an existing PADS/C distribution can be used without any
     modifications. However, if you are using release 1.03 you must
     patch it and rebuild. After unpacking the PADS/ML tarball,
     call

       scripts/patch.sh <pads-c-home>

     from the PADS/ML home directory (the directory in which this
     README file is found). After calling patch.sh, you should
     follow the regular directions in the README to rebuild.

   - Objective Caml, version 3.10.x or higher. Objective Caml is
     available from caml.inria.fr or from
     godi.ocaml-programming.de. GODI includes a package management
     system for ocaml in addition to the standard distribution.  You
     will need version 3.10.x or higher of Objective Caml. Earlier versions
     will not work because of library incompatibilities.

   - camlidl, available at
     http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/camlidl/. Be sure to
     customize the Makefile as directed. For example, on the Mac,
     you'll need to change the setting for variable CPP.

   - XMLlight, http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight.

   - camlp5, available at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/camlp5 or with GODI.
     Be sure to install in "transitional" mode (should be the default).

   - ocamlfind, available with GODI. Not strictly necessary, but helpful. If
     you choose not to install it, then set environment variable NO_OCAMLFIND

STEP 2: Set environment variables.

   After installing the above software, set the following variables to
   their appropriate values, as described:

   PADS_HOME : the root directory of your PADS/C distribution. This
	       variable should already be set by the PADS/C installation.

   PML_HOME : the root directory of your PADS/ML distribution. This
	      should be the same directory as the on in which this README 
	      resides.

   XMLLIGHT_LIB_DIR : the installation directory for XMLlight. If unset, will
		    default to $PML_HOME/arch/<your-arch>/xml
   OCAML_BIN_DIR : the location of the ocaml binaries
   OCAML_LIB_DIR : the location of the ocaml libraries

   CAMLIDL_LIB_DIR : the location of the camlidl libraries. This variable
		     is often the same as OCAML_LIB_DIR.

   NO_OCAMLFIND : if you do not have ocamlfind installed.

   Make sure that the ocaml binaries are accessible from your PATH. The
   camlidl binary should either be accessible from your PATH or its full
   path should be specified in variable CAMLIDL. An example setting for
   these variables, using the bash shell:

   export PML_HOME=$HOME/projects/padsml
   export OCAML_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin/
   export OCAML_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib/ocaml/
   export CAMLIDL_LIB_DIR=$OCAML_LIB_DIR

=========================================
  Building and Testing the PADS/ML 
        Compiler and Library
=========================================

STEP 1: Build the PADS/ML compiler and runtime

   Next, in the root PADS/ML directory, run

     make install

   or, to just make all the files, without installing them:

     make all

STEP 2: Test the pads/ml compiler.

   To test that the pads/ml compiler works on all of the supplied examples,
   do the following from the pads/ml root directory:

     cd examples/tests
     make run_all

   The make command will compile and run all of the example
   programs. It will produce a lot of ouput, so it is recommended to
   redirect the output to a file.

   To process particular example, try:

     make <example-name>

   For example, "make sirius" will compile and run "test_sirius". To do this 
   manually, try:

     make test_sirius
     <your-arch>/test_sirius ../data/sirius.txt

   It will output the parsed data together with the parse descriptors using 
   the debugging tool (found in examples/tools/debug_tool.ml). Notice that this
   particular sample of sirius data has two errors in it.

=========================================
Overview of PADS/ML directory structure
=========================================

Below is a listing of each directory within the PADS/ML root directory
and a brief description of each:

  compiler - source files for PADS/ML compiler.

  runtime  - source files for PADS/ML runtime. These are the modules
    referenced by generated code.
     padsc_interface - source files for ocaml interface to PADS/C runtime.

  examples - 
     pml - PADS/ML descriptions
     gen - empty directory for generated code
     data - sample data sets for descriptions
     tests - simple tests for descriptions

  arch - for each architecture on which PADS/ML is compiled, a different 
     subdirectory is created to store the architecture-specific files.
     The make process will automatically determine the architecture
     and creat an appropriately-named subdirectory into which to install
     compiled files. Currently, in any given architecture-specific directory,
     there is only a lib directory, which contains interface and library 
     files for use in compiling examples. 

  mk - assorted utility make files.

  scratch - scratch space for testing and distributing ideas. Only present in CVS,
     not the distribution.

  scripts - assorted scripts used in making and managing the system.

  pml - a pads/ml interpreter built upon the ocaml toplevel.

  tools - library of generic tools and a module with simple drivers
     for some of the tools.

  dev - directory for developing new parts of the pads/ml infrastructure. Once mature, these
     parts can be transferred into place.
